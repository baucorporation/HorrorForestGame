# The Story Behind the Creation of This Game
I was inspired by the famous creepypasta about Slender Man ‚Äî a tall, faceless figure in a classic black suit with unnaturally long limbs, stalking and attempting to kill the main character. Captivated by the eerie atmosphere and psychological tension of that story, I decided to create a game that captures a similar sense of dread and suspense.
Driven by this idea, I began developing a horror experience that would immerse players in a terrifying encounter with a mysterious and relentless entity. My goal was to recreate the haunting fear of being watched, hunted, and ultimately outmatched by something far beyond human.
This game is the result of that inspiration ‚Äî a tribute to the unsettling mystery and horror that the Slender Man mythos embodies.

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Description
This project was fully built using Roblox Studio. I designed and developed the entire map, which features:
A custom-built forest environment
An interactive door system
A dynamic night atmosphere for added immersion
The goal was to create a complete and atmospheric experience using scripting, lighting, and environmental design within the Roblox engine.
